# Candy-Crush-Game
Through my knowledge of assembly language, I developed a low-level implementation of the candy crush game engine. Using x86 assembly language, I created a highly optimized game engine capable of handling complex game mechanics, such as tile matching, combo chains, and multiple-level options. Through this project is not complete to its end goal, I still gained valuable expertise in assembly language by working and understanding the minute details and workarounds in assembly language.
